# personalWebPage
This is my personal web page! I just started the develoment, hope you like it :D

## URL
https://linkhl09.github.io/personalWebPage/

## Description
Is a one page web site. I tried to divide the sections with hierarchy in order that the content flows.
Also I tried to use card views and focused on a good display on desktop and mobile devices.
It has four main sections in this order.
1.  About me
2.  Academic information (which includes some projects)
3.  My interests
4.  Contact me form!
